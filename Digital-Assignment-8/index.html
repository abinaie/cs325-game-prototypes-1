<h2>Picture Spy!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a Digital prototype of my second physical prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It is challenging for the player to get to find the pictured item among other items in the picture in the given time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little more of JavaScript as well as some Phaser game Logics and functions. This is my new best game so far and I think it is mainly because we had more time for it.
This time I tried to design this one based on my physical prototype that I created last week instead of modifying an existing one. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Digital prototype of my second physical game. + I spy game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find the given objects in the picture until time runs out!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Spy Game!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
KeyBoard space key + Mouse click
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is used to improve the game developing skills of the developer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
With this game I want the player to test their ability to use their eyes to find objects quickly in a sea of objects. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
With this game I want the player to test their ability to use their eyes to find objects quickly in a sea of objects. 
The timer should add a sense of urgency and thrill for the player. 
The addition of a score will also make the player want to play again and again to see how high of a score they can get. 
They will also want to play the game again because after playing a couple of times they will know the locations of certain items. 
Once they find most objects it will become a game of memory to see if they can remember where they saw that particular object during their last game. 
In the digital iteration I want to make the game image dark and add the element of a flashlight that’s controlled by the mouse to add difficulty. 
The added flashlight will make seeing the whole image harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Good memory and luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Story of a young agent looking for his targets!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone could play this game!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on how quickly the player could find the item.
