<h2>The Garbage Collector!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is basically a Snake Game. It is a single player game. The player wins if they be able to collect all of the garbages in the ocean.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It is challenging for the player to control the motion of the garbage collector, since left key goes right and down key goes up and etc. However the speed of collector is reduced.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little more of JavaScript as well as some Phaser game Logics and functions.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
This game uses the assets of the Snake Game and some added challenges and colors.
<ul>
<li>Snake Game: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/tree/master/public/assets/games/snake">here!</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It is similar to the snake game example plus some extra added features. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
To understand how hard it is to track garbages dump in the middle of the ocean! 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Snake Game!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input : Arrow Keys -- Randomness: The location the ocean waves will take garbages is random!  -- Genre : Cleaning. 
The play style I used in this prototype is the Collector style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is used to improve the game developing skills of the developer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
So the player has some fun playing and also to increase their environmental awareness and to understand the fragility of our environment!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
This is a single player game. The player should try to control the garbage collector ship among heavy waves of the pacific ocean and collect all the garbages left behind. However it is not easy to control it you would like go up it goes down and you would like to go left it goes right and so forth.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is to practice to get used to the controller. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The moving part is the garbage collector. The garbage collector gets heavier and longer as it collects more trashes. The player could control the game using the 4 arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone could play this game!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It depends! It could be challenging to get used to the controller.
