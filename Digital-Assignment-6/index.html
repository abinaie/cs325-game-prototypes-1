<h2>The Little Gold Miner</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is basically a Snakes and Ladders Game. It is a single player game. The player wins if they be able to get to the trophy.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It is challenging for the player to get to the last block in a short amount of time because of the ladders that leads to lower blocks. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little more of JavaScript as well as some Phaser game Logics and functions. This is my best game so far and I think it is partly because we had more time for it.
This time I tried to design this one based on my physical prototype that I created last week instead of modifying an existing one. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Tiled Tutorial: <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6">source code</a></li>

    <li>Dice: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/boardgame-pack">item art</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It is similar to the Snakes and Ladders game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The game's goal is to play a little dice/board game for fun! I will try to make it two players game for the next iteration.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Board Game!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input : Keyboard -- Randomness: Dice! -- Genre : Board Game. 
The play style I used in this prototype is the Collector style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is used to improve the game developing skills of the developer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
So the player has some fun playing a board game!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
This is a single player game. The player starts the game by throwing the dice and move the game character accordingly. If the roll of dice leads to a red ladder it takes the player back some number of blocks and if the the roll of dice leads to a green ladder it takes the player some blocks closer to the trophy.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
All you need is a bit of luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The story of a young man who borrowed money, mortgaged his property or spent his life savings to make the arduous journey to California. In pursuit of the kind of wealth he had never dreamed of, he left his families and hometowns to find gold. The player will experience hardships and rewards of this journey.
The player could find some gold if they got lucky and get there faster than the others. The player toss a dice and moves the player accordingly through this journey.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone that could work with the keyboard!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It should take around 2-3 minutes!
</li>
