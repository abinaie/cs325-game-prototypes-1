<h2>The Black Pearl Pirate!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is basically a Shooting Game. It is a single player game. The player wins if they be able to target and hit all 5 monsters in the scene with 5 or less than 5 shots.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It is challenging for one player to hit all 5 of the targets withing 5 shots.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little more of JavaScript as well as some Phaser game Logics and functions.
This time I tried to design a game instead of modifying an existing one. The hardest part was still deciding the game design and lack of time. Creating a new game design was the fun part.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used some of the assets of the Flood-Fill Game as well as a Cannon from arcade example to make my game.
<ul>
<li>Flood-Fill Game Monsters: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/tree/master/public/assets/games/flood">here!</a></li>
<li>Cannon: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/tree/master/public/assets/tests/timer/">there!</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I would say it is a simple shooting game that has used some feature of Flood fill game as well as Mass Debug. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The game's goal is to You sail your trusty vessel through uncharted waters, fighting in tactical ship battles, hunting down bounties, and taking part in an epic high-seas adventure. Well, you will get a very small fraction of that experience in this game though!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Pirate Game!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input : Mouse -- Randomness: No randomness! -- Genre : first person cannon ball shooter. 
The play style I used in this prototype is the Collector style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is used to improve the game developing skills of the developer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
So the player has some fun shooting around some docks! and also a good aiming practice!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
This is a single player game. The player has 5 shots to hit all 5 monsters! The user could use the mouse to aim and mouse left click to shoot. However there is not counter for number of shots or winner update because the developer was short in time!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is to aim well and hit each monster with one shot.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The moving part is the cannon's head as well as monster after they get hit. Monsters will leave the scene after the player successfully hit them. There is only one control, and only one thing you spend time doing in this game, and that is targeting with moving your mouse and left clicking to shoot.    
The player is the captain of the The Black Pearl Pirate ship and should hit all the monsters in his/her way to succeed.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone that could move the mouse and target very short range targets could play this game!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less that 30 seconds in most cases!
</li>
