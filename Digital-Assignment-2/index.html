<h2>Electron Bombardment!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a pong game variation. However, it has its deferences. It is a single player game and it is the player's duty to keep the ball in the scene. There are some other particles in the center of the scene that should be terminated.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It is challenging for one player to keep the Electron (ball) in the scene. The ball could go out from both top and bottom.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little JavaScript as well as some Phaser game Logics and fuctions.
The hardest part was deciding the game and where to start. Modifying the game was the best part.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used some of the assets of the original game and customized it to my liking.
<ul>
<li>Breakout game: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/tree/master/public/assets/games/breakout">Breakout Game</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed the idea and most of the code from Breakout game which is one of Phaser 3 examples.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Player should direct the Electron to remove other tightly bound electrons and particles from an atom. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The Chemist!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input : Mouse -- Randomness : It is not random! -- Genre : Pong variations. 
The play style I used in this prototype is the Joker style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is used to evaluate semantics of the game and the software programming skills of the developer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I guess I did not have any particular player experiece goal for this game. It is my first game so I spent all of my time to make something that is easy to make and fun to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This is a single player game. The player should try to hit other particles in the center of the scene with their electron and aslo keep the electron in the scene with the use of their paddle (Electron Gun). The paddle moves in all directons and the ball could go out of the scene from top and bottom. However, the ball bounces back if it hits the left and right wall of the screen. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
All the player needs to do is to move the mouse swiftly and predict the ball motion after hiting the paddle or other surfaces.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There are exactly two moving parts in this design: one paddle and a ball. There is only one control, and only one thing you spend time doing in this game, and that is moving a paddle up and down, left and right. It is a two dimensional control. Take the time to get it right.    
Like most of other stories there is a protagonist and antagonist in the story of this game too. In this story the antagonist does not do so much to harm the protagonist. The protagonist attacks and removes the antagonists. The protagonist should be careful not to get too exited and go out of the secene since that is the only way the antagonist could win.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
No particular target audience in mind for this game. Anyone from 3 to 120 could play and hopefully enjoy it.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes a bit of time to get used to it at first, but it gets a 5 mins game very soon.
</li>
